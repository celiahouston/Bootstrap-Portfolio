# Bootstrap-Portfolio
In this project I have showcased challenges I have completed during my coursework for the Front-End Web Development bootcamp.
This portfolio showcases my skills and talents. I intend to continually updated my work as the course progresses; thus, I have added card elements that can be updated in the future. 
I have used semantic HTML and CSS, such as including a footer element and checking for correct indentation and alt attributes. I have included the use of Bootstrap components, including a Jumbotron, Navigation bar and card components. 
I have included links to external sites, a hero section, examples of work, how you can contact me, skills and a bit about me. 
I used bootstrap to limit the use of media queries.
